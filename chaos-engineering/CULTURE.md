## Chaos Engineering and DevOps
Chaos engineering is a common practice within the DevOps culture. Such tests allow DevOps to thoroughly analyze applications while keeping up with the tempo of agile development.

DevOps teams commonly use chaos testing to define a functional baseline and tolerances for infrastructure. Tests also help create better policies and processes by clarifying both steady-state and chaotic outputs.

Some companies prefer to integrate chaos engineering into their software development life cycle. Integrated chaos allows companies to ensure the reliability of every new feature.
