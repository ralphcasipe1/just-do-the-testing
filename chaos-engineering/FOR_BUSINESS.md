6 Tips for how to explain Chaos Engineering to non-technical stakeholders

1. Don't be afraid to drop the term

    The faciliation of experiments to uncover systemic weaknesses

    The Magic Safe Word instead of flat chaos engineering:

    > "Limited scope, continuous, disaster recovery"


2. It's about confidence, not breaking things

Chaos Engineering, is about discovery, learning and improving a system in terms of how it reacts to the inevitable stresses of day-to-day usage and system evolution.

Breaking things, carefull, is just one technique to build that confidence. Talking of being careful.

3. Put Blast Radius and Learning Front and Centre

First, you need to emphasize the concept of "blast radius", which is a limited scope.

You need to tell people that you're limiting the scope of the impact of your experiment as much as possible, while still retaining the opportunity to discover, learn and improve the system. This learning loop is, after all a big payback of chaos engineering

4. Not just about Infrastructure, or even just the Technical

It's easy to say it is "Just something the technical people do to infrastructure". 

Chaos engineering addresses all aspects of the sociotechnical system of software development.

Game Days for people, practices & process

Automated Experiments for Application, Platform and Infrastructure

5. It doesn;t have to be a big, up-front investment

The fact is, you probably are already doing some aspects of the discipline already!

If you're doing disaster recovery, or already have a team dedicated to watching SLAs, system availabilty in production, or even people who occasionally put the system through its paces in terms of how it might respond, then you might already be getting some of the benefits of chaos engineering. 

Many organizations start there and grow the awareness and skills of those people into the more proactive, and generally more impactful, practices of chaos engineering.

6. Know the benefits, know the limitations; don't over-promise

It's all too tempting when adopting new technique or discipline such as chaos engineering to get over-excited about the potential benefits of the technique.
