# ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
A company's repuation and bottom-line decrease when their services go down. This cost can be calculated as a dollar-per-hour metric and has become common in many company's KPIs. A sophisticated team uses chaos engineering to decrease the amount of downtime costs.

When a user steams using Netflix, and their service fails, they may switch to a YouTube video and Netflix loses money bevcause they were unable to retain that user's attention. Facebook loses ad revenue when its ads stop working, and Blizzard Entertainment loses video game players if it is known to have regular server outages.

## ADVANTAGES

### Business Benefits

Chaos engineering helps stop large losses in revenue by preventing lengthy outages. The practice also allows companies to scale quickly without losing the reliability of their services.

Chaos Engineering can help prevent extremely large losses in revenue and maintenance costs, create happier and more engaged engineers, improve in on-call training for engineering teams, and improve the SEV (incident) Management Program for the entire company.

### Technical Benefits

Insights from chaos experiments reduce incidents, but that is not where technical benefits end. The team gets an increased understanding of system modes and dependencies, allowing them to build a more robust system design.

A chaos test is also excellent on-call training for the engineering team.

The insights from chaos engineering can mean a reduction in incidents, reduction in on-call burden, increased understanding of system failure modes, improved system design, faster mean time to detection for SEVs, and reduction in repeated SEVs.

### Customer Benefits

Fewer outages mean less disruption for end-users. Improved service availability and durability are the two chief customer benefits of chaos engineering.

the increased availability and durability of service means no outages disrupt their day-to-day lives.
