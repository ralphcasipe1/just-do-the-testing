# LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT

The workflow outlined below insures that critical chaos experiment information is passed along at each stage and informing the next.

## Experiment Lifecycle

1. Define Steady State 
2. Design The Experiment 
3. Induce Chaos
4. Observe, Triage, and Prioritize
5. Increase Experiment Scope
6. Fix The Weakness Identified
