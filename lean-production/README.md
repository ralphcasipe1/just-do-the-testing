Testing, in particular automated test written in code, pervades software engineering. Whether through test-driven development, continuous integration, behavior-driven development, continuous delivery, acceptance test-driven development, specification by example, integration testing, system testing, or unit testing, everyone involved in software-based product development has a chance to write automated tests. Agile, Lean, and software craftsmanship movements.

However, as I have coached teams into testing regimens, I have repeatedly found that the obstacle to adoption is neither a lack of understanding of the process flow, nor a misunderstanding of the concepts, nor an insufficient lexicon, nor skepticism about the value of the practices. All of these obstacles exist in various people at different times, but the most common one that has not been well addressed is simply limited understanding of the mechanics of testing code and of writing testable code.

## Engineering and Craftsmanship
Professional software practitioners code, design, architect, test, measure, and analyze on multiple levels. Several of these activities clearly constitute engineering. The design and validation of others are also clearly engineering. But no matter how you cut it, the act of coding is an act of craftmanship, of doing. We may "engineer" concurrently with motions of our fingers on the keyboard, but we still exercise a craft.

## The Role of Craftsmanship in First-Time Quality

As we all know craftsmanship connotes skill. No matter how much we architect, design, or conceive our software, a poor implementation can undermine it all.

Lean manufacturing operates under a principle of building the quality into a product. Rework is a form of waste to be eliminated from the system. Writing software so you can rewrite it or patch it once the bugs are found is rework.

Improving the craftsmanship aspect of your work pays you and your company back with multipliers. It allows you to deliver more value with less waste in less time and with greater opportunity for personal satisfaction.

I mention approaches to testing that are common in the Agile Playbook. Do not let that deter you from trying them if that is not your flavor of development Whether you practice test-driven development, test first, test early, or test after, you still ned to tame the code under test. Happy Testing!

## Practice Supporting Software Craftsmanship

The ways we can leverage automated code quality tools leads to a taxonomy of software hygiene.

Code coverage tools help you guide your testing by numerically and graphically showing you what parts of your code have been executed, guiding you toward the right Solution.

In a Lean system, you try to prevent defects rather than catch them. The tradition of software testing has been on of catching defects. It should not suprise us, the, that we have an inefficient process. The earlier you test, the sooner you catch defects.

Test-first and test-driven approaches to development bring the testing before the coding.

TDD, the discoveries you make about insufficient foresight and incomplete prior understanding guide the direction of your code.

Additionally, code coverage can deceive. Coverage only show you the code that you executed, not the code you verified. The _usefulness of coverage is only as good as the tests that drive it_. Even well-intentioned developers can become complacent in the face of a coverage report.

Code coverage is a guide, not a goal. Coverage helps you write the right tests to exercise the syntactic execution paths of your code. Your brain still needs to be engaged. Similarly, the quality of the tests you write depends on the skill and attention you apply to the task of writing them.
